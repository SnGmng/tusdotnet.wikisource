If the store being used supports `ITusExpirationStore` (`TusDiskStore` does) you can specify that incomplete files that have not been updated in a set time period should be flagged as expired. This is done automatically by tusdotnet if the Expiration-property is set on the `ITusConfiguration` and if the store supports `ITusExpirationStore`. Files are however not deleted automatically. To help with deleting expired incomplete files the `ITusExpirationStore` interface exposes two methods, `GetExpiredFilesAsync` and `DeleteExpiredFilesAsync`. The former is used to get a list of ids of files that have expired and the latter is used to remove the expired files.

As stated above, tusdotnet does not automatically remove expired files so this needs to be implemented by the developer. It is recommended to add a specific endpoint to the web app that runs the appropriate method. This endpoint can then be polled by a cronjob/webjob.
