The OnBeforeDelete event is fired just before a file is deleted.

Calling FailRequest on the BeforeDeleteContext passed to the callback will reject the request with a 400 Bad Request status code. Calling FailRequest multiple times will concatenate the error messages.

```csharp
app.UseTus(context => new DefaultTusConfiguration
{
	UrlPath = "/files",
	Store = new TusDiskStore(@"C:\tusfiles\"),
	Events = new Events
	{
		OnBeforeDeleteAsync = ctx =>
		{
			if(!SomeBusinessLogic())
			{
				ctx.FailRequest($"Cannot delete {ctx.FileId} due to business logic");
			}
			
			return Task.CompletedTask;
		}
	}
});
```
